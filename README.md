# xNetworking

The **xNetworking** module contains the **xFirewall, xIPAddress** and **xDnsServerAddress** DSC resources for configuring a node’s IP address, DNS server address, and firewall rules.

## Examples

### Set IP Address on an ethernet NIC

This configuration will set the IP Address with some typical values for a network interface with the alias 'Ethernet'.

```powershell
Configuration Sample_xIPAddress_FixedValue
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost'
    )
    Import-DscResource -Module xNetworking
    Node $NodeName
    {
        xIPAddress NewIPAddress
        {
            IPAddress      = "2001:4898:200:7:6c71:a102:ebd8:f482"
            InterfaceAlias = "Ethernet"
            SubnetMask     = 24
            AddressFamily  = "IPV6"
        }
    }
}
```

### Set IP Address with parameterized values

This configuration will set the IP Address and default gateway on a network interface that is identified by its alias.

```powershell
Configuration Sample_xIPAddress_Parameterized
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost',
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$IPAddress,
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$InterfaceAlias,
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$DefaultGateway,
        [int]$SubnetMask = 16,
        [ValidateSet("IPv4","IPv6")]
        [string]$AddressFamily = 'IPv4'
    )
    Import-DscResource -Module xNetworking
    Node $NodeName
    {
        xIPAddress NewIPAddress
        {
            IPAddress      = $IPAddress
            InterfaceAlias = $InterfaceAlias
            DefaultGateway = $DefaultGateway
            SubnetMask     = $SubnetMask
            AddressFamily  = $AddressFamily
        }
    }
}
```

### Set DNS server address

This configuration will set the DNS server address on a network interface that is identified by its alias. 

```powershell
Configuration Sample_xDnsServerAddress
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost',
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$DnsServerAddress,
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$InterfaceAlias,
        [ValidateSet("IPv4","IPv6")]
        [string]$AddressFamily = 'IPv4'
    )
    Import-DscResource -Module xNetworking
    Node $NodeName
    {
        xDnsServerAddress DnsServerAddress
        {
            Address        = $DnsServerAddress
            InterfaceAlias = $InterfaceAlias
            AddressFamily  = $AddressFamily
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding a firewall rule

This configuration will ensure that a firewall rule is present.

```powershell
# DSC configuration for Firewall 
Configuration Add_FirewallRule 
{
    param  
    ( 
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost' 
    ) 
 
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xNetworking 
 
    Node $NodeName 
    { 
        xFirewall Firewall 
        { 
            Name                  = "MyAppFirewallRule"             
            ApplicationPath       = "c:\windows\system32\MyApp.exe" 
            Access                = "Allow" 
        } 
    } 
}
```

### Add a firewall rule to an existing group

This configuration ensures that two firewall rules are present on the target node, both within the same group.

```powershell
Configuration Add_FirewallRuleToExistingGroup 
{ 
    param  
    ( 
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost' 
    ) 
 
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xNetworking 
 
    Node $NodeName 
    { 
        xFirewall Firewall 
        { 
            Name                  = "MyFirewallRule" 
            DisplayName           = "My Firewall Rule" 
            DisplayGroup          = "My Firewall Rule Group" 
            Access                = "Allow" 
        } 
 
        xFirewall Firewall1 
        { 
            Name                  = "MyFirewallRule1" 
            DisplayName           = "My Firewall Rule" 
            DisplayGroup          = "My Firewall Rule Group" 
            Ensure                = "Present" 
            Access                = "Allow" 
            State                 = "Enabled" 
            Profile               = ("Domain", "Private") 
        } 
    } 
}
```

### Disable access to an application

This example ensures that notepad.exe is blocked by the firewall.
```powershell
Configuration Disable_AccessToApplication 
{ 
    param  
    ( 
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost' 
    ) 
 
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xNetworking 
 
    Node $NodeName 
    { 
        xFirewall Firewall 
        { 
            Name                  = "NotePadFirewallRule" 
            DisplayName           = "Firewall Rule for Notepad.exe" 
            DisplayGroup          = "NotePad Firewall Rule Group" 
            Ensure                = "Present" 
            Access                = "Block" 
            Description           = "Firewall Rule for Notepad.exe"   
            ApplicationPath       = "c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe" 
        } 
    } 
}
```

### Disable access with additional parameters

This example will disable notepad.exe's outbound access.

```powershell
Configuration Sample_xFirewall 
{ 
    param  
    ( 
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost' 
    ) 
 
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xNetworking 
 
    Node $NodeName 
    { 
        xFirewall Firewall 
        { 
            Name                  = "NotePadFirewallRule" 
            DisplayName           = "Firewall Rule for Notepad.exe" 
            DisplayGroup          = "NotePad Firewall Rule Group" 
            Ensure                = "Present" 
            Access                = "Allow" 
            State                 = "Enabled" 
            Profile               = ("Domain", "Private") 
            Direction             = "OutBound" 
            RemotePort            = ("8080", "8081") 
            LocalPort             = ("9080", "9081")          
            Protocol              = "TCP" 
            Description           = "Firewall Rule for Notepad.exe"   
            ApplicationPath       = "c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe" 
            Service               =  "WinRM" 
        } 
    } 
 } 
 
Sample_xFirewall 
Start-DscConfiguration -Path Sample_xFirewall -Wait -Verbose -Force
```
