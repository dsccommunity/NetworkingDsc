## Known Issues

### xFirewall Known Issues

The following error may occur when applying xFirewall configurations on Windows
Server 2012 R2 if [KB3000850](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000850) is
not installed. Please ensure this update is installed if this error occurs.

````markdown
    The cmdlet does not fully support the Inquire action for debug messages.
    Cmdlet operation will continue during the prompt. Select a different action
    preference via -Debug switch or $DebugPreference variable, and try again.
````

### Known Invalid Configuraiton

- The exception 'One of the port keywords is invalid' will be thrown if a rule
    is created with the LocalPort set to PlayToDiscovery and the Protocol is not
    set to UDP. This is not an unexpected error, but because the
    New-NetFirewallRule documentation is incorrect.

This issue has been reported on [Microsoft Connect](https://connect.microsoft.com/PowerShell/feedbackdetail/view/1974268/new-set-netfirewallrule-cmdlet-localport-parameter-documentation-is-incorrect-for-playtodiscovery)
