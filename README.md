## Known Invalid Configurations

### xFirewall
* The exception 'One of the port keywords is invalid' will be thrown if a rule is created with the LocalPort set to PlayToDiscovery and the Protocol is not set to UDP. This is not an unexpected error, but because the New-NetFirewallRule documentation is incorrect.
This issue has been reported on [Microsoft Connect](https://connect.microsoft.com/PowerShell/feedbackdetail/view/1974268/new-set-netfirewallrule-cmdlet-localport-parameter-documentation-is-incorrect-for-playtodiscovery)

## Known Issues

### xFirewall
The following error may occur when applying xFirewall configurations on Windows Server 2012 R2 if [KB3000850](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000850) is not installed. Please ensure this update is installed if this error occurs.
```
The cmdlet does not fully support the Inquire action for debug messages. Cmdlet operation will continue during the prompt. Select a different action preference via -Debug switch or $DebugPreference variable, and try again.

            Group                 = "NotePad Firewall Rule Group"
            Ensure                = "Present"
            Action                = 'Blocked'
            Description           = "Firewall Rule for Notepad.exe"
            Program               = "c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"
        }
    }
}
```

### Disable access with additional parameters

This example will disable notepad.exe's outbound access.

```powershell
# DSC configuration for Firewall

configuration Sample_xFirewall_AddFirewallRule
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost'
    )

    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xNetworking

    Node $NodeName
    {
        xFirewall Firewall
        {
            Name                  = "NotePadFirewallRule"
            DisplayName           = "Firewall Rule for Notepad.exe"
            Group                 = "NotePad Firewall Rule Group"
            Ensure                = "Present"
            Enabled               = "True"
            Profile               = ("Domain", "Private")
            Direction             = "OutBound"
            RemotePort            = ("8080", "8081")
            LocalPort             = ("9080", "9081")
            Protocol              = "TCP"
            Description           = "Firewall Rule for Notepad.exe"
            Program               = "c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"
            Service               = "WinRM"
        }
    }
 }

Sample_xFirewall_AddFirewallRule
Start-DscConfiguration -Path Sample_xFirewall_AddFirewallRule -Wait -Verbose -Force
```

### Enable a built-in Firewall Rule

This example enables the built-in Firewall Rule 'World Wide Web Services (HTTP Traffic-In)'.
```powershell
configuration Sample_xFirewall_EnableBuiltInFirewallRule
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost'
    )

    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xNetworking

    Node $NodeName
    {
        xFirewall Firewall
        {
            Name                  = "IIS-WebServerRole-HTTP-In-TCP"
            Ensure                = "Present"
            Enabled               = "True"
        }
    }
 }
```

### Create a Firewall Rule using all available Parameters

This example will create a firewall rule using all available xFirewall resource parameters. This rule is not meaningful and would not be used like this in reality. It is used to show the expected formats of the different parameters.
```powershell
configuration Sample_xFirewall_AddFirewallRule_AllParameters
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost'
    )

    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xNetworking

    Node $NodeName
    {
        xFirewall Firewall
        {
            Name                  = "NotePadFirewallRule"
            DisplayName           = "Firewall Rule for Notepad.exe"
            Group                 = "NotePad Firewall Rule Group"
            Ensure                = "Present"
            Enabled               = "True"
            Profile               = ("Domain", "Private")

### Set the NetConnectionProfile to Public

```powershell
configuration MSFT_xNetConnectionProfile_Config {
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName xNetworking
    node localhost {
        xNetConnectionProfile Integration_Test {
            InterfaceAlias   = 'Wi-Fi'
            NetworkCategory  = 'Public'
            IPv4Connectivity = 'Internet'
            IPv6Connectivity = 'Disconncted'
        }
    }
}
```

### Set the DHCP Client state
This example would set the DHCP Client State to enabled.

```powershell
configuration Sample_xDhcpClient_Enabled
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost',

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$InterfaceAlias,

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [ValidateSet("IPv4","IPv6")]
        [string]$AddressFamily
    )

    Import-DscResource -Module xDhcpClient

    Node $NodeName
    {
        xDhcpClient EnableDhcpClient
        {
            State          = 'Enabled'
            InterfaceAlias = $InterfaceAlias
            AddressFamily  = $AddressFamily
        }
    }
}
```

### Add a Route
This example will add an IPv4 route on interface Ethernet.

```powershell
configuration Sample_xRoute_AddRoute
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost'
    )

    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xNetworking

    Node $NodeName
    {
        xRoute NetRoute1
        {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            InterfaceAlias = 'Ethernet'
            AddressFamily = 'IPv4'
            DestinationPrefix = '192.168.0.0/16'
            NextHop = '192.168.120.0'
            RouteMetric = 200
        }
    }
 }
